NoteAPI is an experiment to see if web APIs would be easier to use if they communicated using simple hash tables.

Note is a concise encoding for hash tables. NoteAPI uses Note to provide example interfaces to a few popular web apis.

We believe APIs could be so simple you would barely need documentation for most use cases, and this is a step toward that goal.
