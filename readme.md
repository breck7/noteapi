NoteAPI
=======

Goal
----
Make APIs so simple they don't need documentation.

Problem
-------
Working with APIs is painful. Note makes it a lot easier. NoteAPI is a set of libraries that create Note interfaces to existing JSON APIs.

NoteAPI gives you Note interfaces to existing APIs that don't have Note interfaces yet.
